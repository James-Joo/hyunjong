								<h3>MyInterview: Mock Interview App</h3>
								<p>The demand for non-face-to-face AI interviews continues to increase. In particular, due to COVID-19, demand for AI interviews and their preparation has increased immensely.
Through this project, we built an AI-backed smartphone application that can assist interview practice and job applications. The project has been fully funded by the Yonsei Enterprise Support Foundation.

								<h3>Social VR as the New Normal?: Understanding User Interactions for the Business Arena</h3>
							<p>	The increased demand for carbon footprint reduction and online meetings will bring a “New Normal” in the business arena. With the research team of Professor Soojin Jun of Yonsei University in South Korea, we researched the application of Social VR in a business context. We conducted a survey, and interviewed more than 300 working professionals from the United States, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, etc.
</br>
<b>⨳ The research has submitted to CHI 2021, the most prestigious HCI journal in (January 2021)</b>

								<h3>User Perception on an Artificial Intelligence Counseling App</h3>
								<p>In the modern society, an individual’s concern for mental health is increasingly important. In particular, the largest mortality rate for youth in South Korea is due to self-injury. Through this study, we investigated reasons why many South Korean college students currently do not use psychological counseling services provided by schools and developed technology-based solutions.
</br>
<b>⨳ After the publication of the research, I have developed the prototyped the framework further with advice from Hyundae General Hospital and Pentaworks. In December 2020, I have received awards from the Seoul Metropolitan Government with the developed prototype. </b>
</br>
<b>⨳ Currently, I am working on the project with Cogito, a Korean IT and education start-up, and we are developing solutions for youth through continuous consultation from Hyundae General Hospital and Pentaworks.</b>

								<h3>What is K-MOOC? The Direction for K-MOOC in the New Normal Era</h3>
								<p>I believe that technological advances will enable the underprivileged and the general public to receive higher quality educational benefits effectively. Moreover, I believe that quality education is the most reliable investment for our society. Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is still classified as a relatively new service in South Korea, but the necessity and possibility of growth in the field are gradually increasing. Together with the University of Toronto in Canada and Yonsei University in South Korea, we analyzed the current situation of MOOC services in South Korea and suggested the direction of development based on the opinions of the MZ generation.</p>
